Crime scene investigation
Location : Middle of an empty field . Early hours of Monday morning. 

Officer in charge : "this is an odd one Henry, think we need to call you know you."
Henry :             "You mean, THAT guy."
Stevey:             "Oh ! Surely not that oddball. What are you getting him for ?!"
Chief :             "Well he's odd alright. But still oddly better than the lot of us put together."
Henry :             "I'll give him a call chief." 
(Steveey's expression changes to disapproval)

--1 hour later--
Far in the distance you can see a car stop, old mustang, a muscle car. Driver steps out , head slowly towards the group of policeman . 
Behind the chief are the 2 assisting officers, sitting next to each other
 Chief: "Detective Wildcard, glad to see you son"
(Stevey with some disbelief leans towards Henry.
(Stevey " Is this the guy ?")
(Henry  "Yep.")
(Stevey "he doesn't seem all that" )
(Henry  "Yep")
(Stevey "So he's name IS Wildcard" )
(Henry  "Yep")
(Stevey "That's a bit odd isn't it")
(Henry  "Yep")

Cheif: "Thanks for doing us the favour and coming down. This is an odd one and we kind of hit a wall here. Can't figure it out , that's why we need your help Willy." 
(Stevey: "Hrhrhrhaharrr!" , swalowing his laughter ) 
(Chief turns around with a criticising look. He then leans towards Willy and says : "Don't mind the rookie. He's a good kid" ) 
Chief: "So Detective!" the chief says in a lewder voice while corner eyeing the two officers behind him. 
       "We'll provide what ever you require. Just let us know what you need to solve this case."

  """With a content look on his face, Willy starts to collect his thoughts. He reaches to the inside of his jacket and pulls out a cartridge of cigars and a lighter. 
     He takes one puff and looks satisfied. As he seems to about to say something he starts coughing violently and falls to the ground.
     Paramedics at the scene of the crime rush to save him. They conclude it's cancer and fail to save the detective. He dies within a few minutes. 
     Henry : "Such a shame" shaking his head in denial. 
     Chief : "This is what you get when smoking. Rest in peace Wildcard."

    Chief : "Coffee ?" A bit of a confused look could be noticed on the chief's face. 
    Chief : Stevey , you heard the man, get him a coffee . 
    Stevey: Coffe ? But we're in the middle of nowhere, where the heck am I going to get coffee here. The nearest town is an hour away.
            Chief turns around with an angry look in his eyes. Stevey suddenly realises his mischief. 
    Stevey: Yes sir , chief. On my way!  As he starts rushing to the cars in the distance. 
    Cheif turns back to the Willy: "Well that will probably take him a while . Shall we continue meanwhile ?
