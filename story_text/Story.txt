The wait
========
'Tick, tock , tick, tock ' went the little round clock on the wall. 
'Tick, tock, tick ,tock 'as it went some more.....
Swollen eyes , messy hair , elbows on the table supporting my head. I'm sitting here, barely awake, waiting for time to pass. I can't sleep. More honestly don't want too. Or I may just miss it.

'Tick, tock , tick, tock' and as I look up again, I see only one minute pass. 
"Oh so slow.... such a long wait... "
Resting my head on the table, I check my wrist watch in disbelief. But it shows the same time, as the one on the wall. Quarter past twelve and 4 hours to go.
"Sorry for not believing you clock on the wall. You'd never lie to me, you never did and never will.". How could you. You're just a clock.

The room is quiet, if you ignore the clock. Spiders are busy building their webs on my cracked and scruffy wall. A dusty blackboard is sitting on the wall, with months of my research on it. 

I look to my left, test sample is motionless. Just sitting there inactive, and irritating.  "Aha maybe just to the naked eye", i say to myself; "4 more hours I will see the truth". And all the torment, this terrible old room that i have to work in, "it will all be worth it" i whisper again

"For i shall be immortal!", and I smile.

Remember
========

What is more amazing then the solution, and a most artistic representation on a blackboard? 
It is the journey.

And how amazing my journey was! With it's colossal obstacles, desolate planes of ignorance and regions arid of human compassion. Yes , my journey was one of the mind, but still a significant journey nonetheless.

Exam
====
Staring at the clock... 'Tick, tock , Tick tock' one minute to go and then we can start. 
In large bright room, rows of small desks stretching on all sides and a pile of blank pages in front of me. The room is packed with people, not one single desk is missing a person, and you can feel the anxiety in the air. 

We're at braking point, a fork in the road. For most of us , including myself, the future will be determined now. 

"Bzzz!!!", sets the  start.
I quickly turn over the blank sheets of paper in front of me and only to find a think bold title .
Just now, do I feel cold sweats and the node in my throat. How scared can one become... from reading two black words on a piece of paper?

'Examination Paper' 

Surely, this is not the only exam in my lifetime or the last only job left in the world. But it is, THE EXAM for THE JOB. If I am to achieve my 'perfect' future, I better not fail.

As I turn the first page, the scribbling sound of pens echos catches my ear. As far as my eyes can see people were focused on the papers in front of them.

Not that I can see very far without my glasses. I wonder where they are, and how is it that I did not notice them missing sooner. I look around the room searching for them until my sight meets the angry stare of one of the examiners. Fear and embarrassment overcome and i quickly turn my view twards the paper in front of me. 
'Never mind my glasses, I'm short sited any way !'

The Questions
=============
It seemed to stretch for miles, this colossal paper in front of me. Closing my eyes, breathing deeply, I started counting to ten.
By the time I reached the final digits in my count, "eight... nine ... ten... ", I became ready, determined to take on the challenge and read the first question.

	Q1.
