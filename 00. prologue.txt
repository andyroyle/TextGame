Prologue [no more than 20-30 seconds. user could be bored, so it must be done quickly, just to stirr the interest.]

[user should not have to press anything to change the scenes. like a movie or some sort. heavy dynamics intended. capture him through words and change of scenes.]
[Normal typewriter font]

Believe.

[New scene]

That's what they told me.

[new scene]
["everything" - bold on white background, appearing immediately' "you see/you touch/you feel" - fading in in normal font putting emphasis on them
maybe put a recording of a whisper saying "everything" each time it appears barely audible, not to disturb the user, with a short delay (musical effect) - not sure if good yet, i just want to get in his head and make him feel the story more intesively]

"Everything you see, everything you touch, everything you feel is real. You just have to believe it."

[Normal typewriter font]
[same scene]

I hear whispers in my sleep, voices bragging about their reality. 
Who are they? What do they want from me?

[new scene]
[normal typewriter font]

It's like a sweet violin melody entering my ears, convincing my brain to alter my thoughts. Sending fading images to my eyes, only to see them day after day, without being able to remember where I had seen all these scenes.

[new scene]
[random letters appearing and dissapearing - no meaning intended - maybe whispers in the background, nothing intelligible]

[new scene]
[normal typewriter font]
[somehow bring forward "I always ask for more" - no idea how yet]

There's no comfort in my reality. That's why I listen. That's why I hope to hear more. I always ask for more. That's why they are able to creep upon me and shift me like a lifeless puppet. I soullessly accept every message they send.

[new scene]
["believe" - fade in -> after few seconds(or less, needs experimenting), quickly transforming into "I did" if it can be made]

"Believe."
I did. And I was wrong.

/
[new scene]
[middle of the screen - "so wrong" fading in - italic font -> fade out]

So wrong.

/
[New scene]
[this is where the user starts interfering with the game.]
[short tutorial - slightly different font, so the user knows it's something different about it, but keep the sensation of being part of the story. not sure yet how, but i think that it should be there. to keep the focus of playing the game more than waiting for answers to come.]

My choices are yours now. My voice whispers your words. Choose your questions wisely, so you can get the right answers and answer the questions like they hold something dear to you that needs to be freed. Will you help me share this burden? 

[text box for answer - "yes/i will/of course/yea etc."]

/
[new scene]
[every sentence fading in and in the end both fading out]

Thank you. Let us begin.

[text box for answer - "no/neah/i won't etc."]

/
[new scene]
[angry/sad effect? i'll look into it to see if this feeling could be transmitted through an effect of writing. if not, i'll think of something else]

Then I shall continue alone. May my steps carry me where you couldn't.

[exit game with no other explanation. that should teach the motherfucker a lesson :)))]

/
[if the user enters the game again from the same account/device etc.]
[new scene]

I see you've come back. Had a change of heart?

[text box for answer - "yes/sure etc."]

/
[new scene]

Good. Let's flip the page and see where the story takes us.

/
[text box for answer - anything else besides "yes/no" or anything with the same meaning but no curse words]
[new scene]

That is not what I asked. If you're not sure, maybe we should wait until you decide where your heart stands. Shall we wait? 

[text box for answer - "yes/i think etc."]
[new scene]

All right. Make sure you come back when you've changed your mind.

[exit game]

/
[text box for answer - "no/not really etc."]
[new scene]

Good. Let us go on, then.


[i'll think of other things user may write]
